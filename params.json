{"name":"Shut The Box","tagline":"Shut the Box game in vanilla JavaScript","body":"### Welcome to Shut the Box\r\nShut the Box, also called **Canoga, Klackers, Zoltan Box, Batten Down the Hatches**, or **High Rollers**, is a game of dice for one or more players, commonly played in a group of two to four for stakes. Traditionally, a counting box is used with tiles numbered 1 to 9 where each can be covered with a hinged or sliding mechanism, though the game can be played with only a pair of dice, pen, and paper. Variations exist where the box has up to 10 or 12 tiles.\r\n\r\n### Rules\r\nAt the start of the game all levers or tiles are \"open\" (cleared, up), showing the numerals 1 to 9.\r\n\r\nDuring the game, each player plays in turn. A player begins his or her turn by throwing or rolling the die or dice into the box. If 1 is the only tile still open, the player may roll only one die. Otherwise, the player must roll both dice.\r\n\r\nAfter throwing, the player adds up the dots (pips) on the dice and then \"shuts\" (closes, covers) one of any combination of open numbers that equals the total number of dots showing on the dice. For example, if the total number of dots is 8, the player may choose any of the following sets of numbers (as long as all of the numbers in the set are available to be covered):\r\n\r\n* 8\r\n* 7, 1\r\n* 6, 2\r\n* 5, 3\r\n* 5, 2, 1\r\n* 4, 3, 1\r\n\r\n### To Play\r\nDownload the repo and extract it, double click on index.html to play.
